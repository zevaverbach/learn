# Chapter 1

Three desirable properties of an algorithm:

1. correct
2. efficient
3. easy to implement

Implemented insertion sort (insertion_sort.py).
Tried to implement robot tour optimization, but it only uses "nearest neighbor" which fails with the second collection of coordinates (the rectangle).

The explanation of how to solve robot tour optimization has math which I'm not familiar with, so I'll double back to the math book.

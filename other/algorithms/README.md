		- ask for a specific runtime that your solution should be
		- filter out the data structures and algorithms that aren't relevant to the problem
				- too slow
				- impossible to use
		- go through the use cases of the remaining data structures and see which ones are relevant. the answer will be a combination of those use cases.

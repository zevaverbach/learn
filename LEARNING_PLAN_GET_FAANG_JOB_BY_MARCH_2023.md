# Daily Practice: LeetCode

- [The problems to study (Neetcode)](https://neetcode.io/practice)

## Process

- log your progress [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kVQnbyaQydSDabHwToBsr3_COxGeVLif44EhG2EiOzA/edit#gid=0)
		- that's also where to see what problems to circle back to

- do two 90-minute study cycles a day, with 10 minutes of eyes closed at the end of each cycle, letting your mind roam and relax. ([Huberman ep. 20](https://github.com/lord-denning/Huberman-Lab-Podcast-Transcripts/blob/main/20.%20How%20To%20Learn%20Skills%20Faster.md))

- only spend 20-25 minutes per problem (Will Sommers)
		- look at the answer if needed, put it back in the queue for a week from now
    - do a problem marked "similar" immediately if you want
- don't bother with dynamic programming Qs


# Books

- System Design Interview vol. 1 and 2
- Elements of Programming Interviews in Python

# Courses

# Interview Prep

- watch the relevant videos [here (anthonywritescode)](https://www.youtube.com/c/anthonywritescode/search?query=interview)
- [An Algorithm for Coding Interviews](https://malisper.me/an-algorithm-for-passing-programming-interviews/)
		- ask for a specific runtime that your solution should be
		- filter out the data structures and algorithms that aren't relevant to the problem
				- too slow
				- impossible to use
		- go through the use cases of the remaining data structures and see which ones are relevant. the answer will be a combination of those use cases.
- get mock interviews, paid or unpaid
  - do them frequently!

# Open Source Contributions

It's been a while! Find something compelling -- probably something in neovim land, or maybe Python -- and run with it.

- contribute to the neovim ecosystem
		- learn about tree-sitter, its parser (used in many other applications too, including cursorless)
    - look through [these issues](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Acomplexity%3Alow) (neovim)
    - check out their [devchat](https://app.element.io/#/room/#neovim-dev:matrix.org)
## Sleep and Supplements

- alpha GPC, 600mg twice a day (adapted from Huberman)
- 8 hours of sleep opportunity per day

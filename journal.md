- reached out on RC Jobs thread to get hooked up with mock interviews
- came up with one solution to [this LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/) (Group Anagrams), as I work my way through the top of NeetCode
- started re-reading Interview Cake
  - left off near the end of [linked lists](https://www.interviewcake.com/article/python3/data-structures-coding-interview?course=fc1&section=algorithmic-thinking#linked-lists)
  - implemented a Linked List in Python, plus some helper functions to print one and insert data into one

- instead of doing leetcode I've been reading about lichess, which is open source and services a lot of users. It's slick, I can't remember why I used chess.com over it.

Really have fallen off the algorithm horse. Feeling like I'm not meant to be a full-time worker bee, and instead would like to resume my independent life while also going deep on computing. Ideally I'd enroll in a Comp Sci program (undergrad/grad) but can't see how the $ could work currently. Very interested in falling back to Averbach Transcription and spending a lot of time on machine + human interfaces/processes.

I never returned to algo questions, instead diving into C++ then C. How I arrived at C: I have a case of FOMO regarding Rust and low-level programming, but I want to know what problems Rust is solving (memory management) in a hands-on way. Also, I bought the Python programming interview book and there are a bunch of bit-shifting and bit-masking maneuvers happening there, which are totally foreign to me. That led me to buy "Write Great Code, Volume 1: Understanding the Machine" which gets you down to binary, assembly, and C.

There is of course a tension between this sort of deep dive and the goal of getting a new job. I feel the tension but I also really enjoy exploring C, and I'm excited at the prospect of being able to understand and contribute to things like cpython, neovim, Arduino, etc.
